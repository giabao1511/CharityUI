    shortDescription: "Bring clean drinking water to 10 villages in rural Kenya through sustainable well systems.",
    fullDescription: `
      Access to clean water is a fundamental human right, yet millions in rural Africa still lack this basic necessity. Our project aims to bring sustainable, clean water solutions to 10 villages in rural Kenya, impacting over 5,000 people directly.

      **The Problem:**
      Communities in these villages currently walk an average of 3 hours daily to fetch water from contaminated sources, leading to waterborne diseases and lost educational opportunities for children.

      **Our Solution:**
      We will install solar-powered deep well systems with water purification technology. Each system will serve 500+ people and includes:
      - Deep well drilling (100-150 meters)
      - Solar-powered pumping systems
      - Water purification stations
      - Community training for maintenance
      - 5-year maintenance program

      **Impact:**
      - 5,000+ people with access to clean water
      - 50% reduction in waterborne diseases
      - 15+ hours saved per week per family
      - Increased school attendance by 30%

    fullDescription: `
      Every child deserves access to quality education, but many children in underserved communities lack basic school supplies. This campaign aims to bridge that gap.

      **Our Mission:**
      Provide comprehensive school supply kits to 1,000 children across 20 schools in underserved areas. Each kit includes notebooks, pens, pencils, erasers, rulers, school bags, and age-appropriate reading books.

      **Why This Matters:**
      - Many families can't afford basic school supplies
      - Lack of materials leads to lower academic performance
      - Children often share supplies, reducing learning effectiveness
      - Access to books promotes literacy and imagination

      **What We're Providing:**
      - Complete school supply kits for 1,000 students
      - Age-appropriate reading books library (500 books per school)
      - Quarterly supply replenishment for one year
      - Teacher training on resource utilization
